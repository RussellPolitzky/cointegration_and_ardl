# Gemini CLI Session Summary

This document summarizes the work completed during the interactive session with the Gemini CLI.

## Project: ARDL Cointegration Experiments

The session focused on enhancing a project related to Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) models and cointegration analysis.

### Key Accomplishments:

1.  **Z-Plane Illustration:**
    *   An SVG image (`z_plane.svg`) of the Z-plane was generated to illustrate the unit circle and the `z=1` point, which is critical for understanding the Final Value Theorem in the context of discrete-time systems.
    *   The colors and text positioning of the SVG were adjusted to match the "darkly" theme of the existing Quarto documents.

2.  **Quarto Document Enhancements:**
    *   The generated `z_plane.svg` was embedded into the main `ARDL Experiments.qmd` file to visually support the explanation of Z-domain techniques.

3.  **Formal Proof Creation:**
    *   A new, detailed Quarto document (`ARDL_Cointegration_Proof.qmd`) was created from scratch.
    *   This document provides a rigorous mathematical proof on how to derive the long-run multipliers and the cointegration vector from an ARDL model's difference equation.
    *   The proof was developed to explicitly use:
        *   The Z-transform.
        *   The Final Value Theorem.
        *   A formal derivation of the system's transfer function, H(z).
        *   A clear explanation of how the intercept (a constant) is handled in the Z-domain.
    *   The `z_plane.svg` illustration was also included in the proof to connect the mathematical theory to a visual representation.

4.  **Quarto Formatting Convention:**
    *   A key convention was established for formatting numbered equations in Quarto to ensure correct rendering and cross-referencing. Equations must use display math `$$...$$` with the label placed on the same line as the closing `$$`.
    *   **Example:** 
    
    $$ 
    a = b + c 
    $$ {#eq-example}

    *   This convention has been saved as a preference for all future work on this project.  Please ensure that this format is used for all equations.

5. When formatting equations, please use the following style:

    a = b
      = c

    instead of:
    
    a = b = c
